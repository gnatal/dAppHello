1. Install Dependencies
Install the project dependencies in the root directory:

npm install

2. Compile the Smart Contracts
Compile your Solidity contracts with Hardhat:

npx hardhat compile

3. Run Tests
Run the provided tests to verify contract functionality:

npx hardhat test

4. Deploy the Contract Locally
Start a Local Hardhat Node
In a new terminal window, start the local blockchain:

npx hardhat node

This will output several pre-funded accounts along with their private keys.

Deploy the Contract
In another terminal window, run the deploy script:

npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network localhost

Take note of the contract address printed in the console (e.g., 0xe7f1725E7734CE288F8367e1Bb143E90bb3F0512).

5. Configure MetaMask
Add the Hardhat Network
Open MetaMask and click on the network selector.
Click "Add Network" and use the following settings:
Network Name: Hardhat
New RPC URL: http://127.0.0.1:8545
Chain ID: 31337 (or your Hardhat node's chain ID)
Currency Symbol: ETH
Import a Pre-funded Account
Use one of the private keys shown in your Hardhat node terminal to import an account into MetaMask.
Switch to this account to ensure you have enough test ETH for transactions.
6. Run the React Frontend
Navigate to the frontend directory:

cd frontend
npm install
npm start

This command starts the React development server and opens the dApp in your default browser.

7. Interact with the dApp
The dApp will display the current message and the active MetaMask account.
Use the provided interface to update the message or append additional text.
Ensure MetaMask is connected to the Hardhat network and using the correct pre-funded account.
File Structure
contracts/HelloWorld.sol
The Solidity contract that stores and manipulates the message.

scripts/deploy.ts
The deployment script for deploying the contract to the local Hardhat network.

test/hello-world-test.ts
Hardhat tests that verify the functionality of the contract.

frontend/src/HelloWorldDapp.tsx
The React component that connects to and interacts with the smart contract.

frontend/src/App.tsx
The main React application file.

Troubleshooting
Network Issues:
Make sure MetaMask is connected to the Hardhat network (http://127.0.0.1:8545 with chain ID 31337).

Account Issues:
Verify that you have imported a Hardhat account with sufficient test ETH into MetaMask.

Contract Address:
Ensure the contract address in the frontend (contractAddress variable) matches the one printed during deployment.
